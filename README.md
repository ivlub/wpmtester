Welcome to wpmtester by ivlub!
Test your typing speed and accuracy in terminal.

The program generates a given amount of words (the default is 10) and you type them in. It then measures your time in seconds, typing speed in wpm (words per minute) and accuracy in percent.
It contains a list of around a 1000 most used english words.

My goal was to make it as simplistic and clean as possible, so one could easily use it in the terminal.

I recommend adding the wpm.exe file to your program files, then search for "Edit environment variables" in the search bar, double-click path and press new. Copy the file directory and you are done.

Now, if you type wpm into the command line, it opens the program. As I've said before, the default value is 10 words. If you type wpm 15, the value for the current session would be 15 words, wpm 20 would be 20 words and so on.

There also is a simple personal best system. Each time you get a new highscore wpm, it replaces the old one.
